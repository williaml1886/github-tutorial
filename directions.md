### A note about plagiarism
You should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.

### Final thoughts
The best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  
Feel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.  
Don't forget to use [Google](http://www.google.com) if you get stuck!
